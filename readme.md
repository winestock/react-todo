#Todo App

This is a todo app which I wrote in order to learn React.

## Getting Started
Go to the [Heroku site](https://evening-lowlands-28946.herokuapp.com) to see the app in action.  Log in with your GitHub account.

## Built With

Along with React, itself, I learned how to use several other resources in the course of making this app.

1. [Babel](http://babeljs.io) - JavaScript transpiler
1. [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) - JavaScript module bundler
1. [Axios](http://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - Promises-based HTTP client
1. [SCSS/Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
1. [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) - Bootstrap alternative
1. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - for deployment
1. [Expect](http://github.com/mjackson/expect) - for testing
1. [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) - test runner
1. [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - test framework
1. [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - state container for JavaScript
1. [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) - JSON database store
